Welcome to our world of Dip Stripping/Chemical Stripping. 

We have been working in this field since 1985 and over the years City Strippers have paint stripped, prepared, and restored everything from antique prams, furniture, horse carriages, train carriages, planes, boats, ship galleys, cars, motorbikes. houses and buildings.One of our most notable jobs was Parliament Building in which we stripped all windows, doors wall panels etc.

When it comes to paint stripping and restoration City strippers want to share our knowledge with you.
Our focus today is our fantastic Dip Stripping Service. 
This process is great for removing paint, varnish, stains etc from solid doors, skirting, fire surrounds, furniture, windows, weatherboards and many other items including metals and plastic hardware for example.

This stripping process is a very cost effective way to remove the paint etc and expose the expensive native timbers underneath.

With the preparation work done for you, we can make the job easy for you to finish with detailed instructions which will guide you through the process on how to complete the work to obtain the desired finish. Or we can do the complete process for you.

We can pick up and deliver or you can drop off your goods at Wairarapa Building Recyclers /rummages.co.nz 119C Lincoln Road, Masterton 06 370 3044 or Wellington 04 977 8007  City Strippers 04 566 9990.
